Made this brick breaker game in order to learn more about the Java programming language.  The game isn't coded very well, and some of the logic is bad (e.g. collision detection), but it taught me a lot about Java programming, which is all I really cared about.  For my purposes, it's "finished".

Arrow keys to move and such.  But it's really bad so nobody should be playing it anyway.
